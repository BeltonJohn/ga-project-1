## Project

## ProjectOverview

Nibbler Bytes was born out of a documentary I had seen about the arcade game of a similar name.
When I learned of the firs SEI project to make a grid based game with vanilla JavaScript this is what initally sprang to mind. This project was the first time to apply everything I had learned in the opening few weeks of the SEI course.

### Duration:

7days

### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## The Brief

Our brief was to create a grid-based game using only JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

requisite feature specifically for a snake game wer as follows:

*The snake should grow when it eats a piece of food
*The snake should speed up when it eats a pice of food

## Initial Steps

I started by pseudocoding the steps needed to make an MVP which in my mind was a moving snake in a grid.
